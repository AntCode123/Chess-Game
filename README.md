# Chess-Game
•	This is a multiplayer online chess game made in python using the pygame and socket libraries
• Two different computers can connect to a server and then player each other at a game of chess
• I followed a tutorial for how to set up a server / client connection using sockets
• However the chess Game itself was my own implementation
• Features: first pawn moves two squares, checks, castling, possible moves highlights
• The main feature I did not implement was checkmate
• in order to win the game, the players have to take eachothers' kings.
